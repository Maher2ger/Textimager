Die Gattung umfasst etwa 42 bis 55 Arten laubwerfender Bäume und Sträucher aus Wäldern und Dickichten der nördlichen gemäßigten Zone in Europa, Asien und Nordamerika, aus denen auch eine große Anzahl an oft schwer unterscheidbaren Hybriden hervorgegangen ist.\n\nDie weltweit mit Abstand bekannteste und wirtschaftlich sehr bedeutende Art ist der Kulturapfel (Malus domestica). Daneben werden manche aus Ostasien stammende Arten mit nur etwa kirschgroßen Früchten, wie etwa der Japanische Apfel (Malus floribunda), der Kirschapfel (Malus baccata) und Malus ×zumi in gemäßigten Klimagebieten als Ziersträucher und -bäume angepflanzt. Nicht zu verwechseln mit den Äpfeln sind die nicht näher verwandten Granatäpfel (Punica granatum).\n\n\nWortherkunft\nDas Wort Apfel wird auf die indogermanische Grundform *h₂ébōl zurückgeführt, die nur Fortsetzungen im Nordwestindogermanischen (Germanisch, Keltisch, Baltisch und Slawisch) hat und dort in allen Formen den Apfel bezeichnet. In der Forschung herrscht Uneinigkeit darüber, wie die Form genau anzusetzen ist und ob es sich um das indogermanische Apfelwort handelt oder eine Entlehnung aus einer nicht-indogermanischen Sprache (vgl. kasachisch alma, burushaski báalt[1]).[2][3] Aus der idg. Genitivform *h₂eb-l-ós[4] entwickelt sich das urgermanische Apfelwort *aplaz, aus dem (mit westgermanischer Gemination vor -l-) althochdeutsch apful, afful > Apfel (Mehrzahl epfili > Äpfel), englisch apple und niederländisch appel hervorgehen.[5]\n\nBeschreibung\nHabitus und Belaubung\nDie Arten der Gattung Äpfel (Malus) sind sommergrüne Bäume oder Sträucher. Sie sind meist unbewehrt. Die wechselständig angeordneten Laubblätter sind gestielt. Die einfache Blattspreite ist oval bis eiförmig oder elliptisch. Die Blattränder sind meist gesägt, selten glatt und manchmal gelappt. Einige Arten bzw. Sorten werden wegen ihres purpurnen Laubes im Herbst geschätzt. Nebenblätter sind vorhanden, verwelken aber oft früh.\n\nBlütenstände und Blüten\nDie gestielten Blüten der Apfelbäume stehen einzeln oder in doldigen schirmrispigen Blütenständen. Die fünfzähligen, zwittrigen, radiärsymmetrischen Blüten sind meist flach becherförmig und weisen meist einen Durchmesser von 2 bis 5 cm auf. Häufig duften die Blüten. Die Blütenachse ist krugförmig. Die fünf grünen Kelchblätter sind auch noch an den Früchten erhalten. Die fünf freien Kronblätter sind weiß, rosa oder rot. In jeder Blüte sind viele (15 bis 50) Staubblätter vorhanden, mit weißen Staubfäden und gelben Staubbeuteln. Aus drei bis fünf Fruchtblättern besteht der unterständige Fruchtknoten. Die drei bis fünf Griffel sind nur an ihrer Basis verwachsen. Bei einigen Züchtungen sind die Blüten, durch Umwandlung der Staubblätter in kronblattähnliche Blütenblätter, halbgefüllt oder gefüllt.\n\n\nQuerschnitt durch einen Apfel\nFrüchte und Samen\nGemeinhin bekannt sind die mehr oder minder rundlichen, essbaren Früchte. Bei einigen Arten sind sie roh ungenießbar. Das fleischige Gewebe, das normalerweise als Frucht bezeichnet wird, entsteht nicht aus dem Fruchtknoten, sondern aus der Blütenachse; der Biologe spricht daher von Scheinfrüchten. Genauer ist die Apfelfrucht eine Sonderform der Sammelbalgfrucht. Ein Balg besteht aus einem Fruchtblatt, das mit sich selbst verwächst. Innerhalb des Fruchtfleisches entsteht aus dem balgähnlichen Fruchtblatt ein pergamentartiges Gehäuse. Im Fruchtfleisch selbst sind höchstens noch vereinzelt Steinzellennester enthalten. Die Samen sind braun oder schwarz; sie enthalten geringe Mengen an giftigen Cyaniden.\n\nSystematik der Arten\n\nSektion Chloromeles: Blüten des Süßen Wildapfel (Malus coronaria)\n\nSektion Florentinae: Früchte von Malus florentina\n\nSektion Gymnomeles: Früchte von Malus sikkimensis\n\nSektion Malus: Früchte von Malus prunifolia\n\nSektion Malus: Blüten von Malus transitoria\n\nMalus ×asiatica, Blüten mit genagelten Kronblättern\nDie Gattung Malus gehört zur Subtribus Pyrinae der Tribus Pyreae in der Unterfamilie Spiraeoideae innerhalb der Familie Rosaceae. Der Gattungsname Malus wurde 1754 durch Philip Miller in Gard. Dict. Abr. 4. Auflage, S. 835 erstveröffentlicht. Synonyme für Malus Mill. sind: Docyniopsis (C.K.Schneid.) Koidz., Eriolobus (DC.) M.Roem.[6]\n\nEs gibt etwa 42 bis 55 Malus-Arten; hier eine Auflistung mit Heimatangaben. Zu den bekannten Sorten der fruchtliefernden Apfelbäume siehe Kulturapfel und Apfelsorten. In China sind etwa 25 Arten zu finden, davon 15 nur dort.

Bananen (Musa), veraltet Paradiesfeigen, sind eine Pflanzengattung in der Familie der Bananengewächse (Musaceae) innerhalb der Einkeimblättrigen Pflanzen (Monokotyledonen). Die etwa 70 Arten stammen – bis auf eine Art in Tansania – alle aus dem tropischen bis subtropischen Asien und westlichen Pazifikraum.\nEinige Arten und Hybriden bilden essbare Früchte, von denen die der Dessertbanane (Musa × paradisiaca) zum Teil für die Nahrungsmittelproduktion angebaut werden.\n\n\nBeschreibung\n\nErscheinungsbild und Blätter\n\nMusa-Arten und -Sorten sind immergrüne, ausdauernde, krautige Pflanzen. Unterirdisch besitzen sie ein Rhizom, aus dem Ausläufer treiben. Die eigentliche Sprossachse bleibt bis zur Blütezeit sehr kurz. Der \"Stamm\" ist ein aus den massiven Blattstielen bzw. Blattscheiden bestehender, nicht verholzender Scheinstamm. Er wird mindestens einen halben Meter, meist aber drei bis zehn Meter hoch. An der Basis kann er etwas verdickt sein. Die großen, einfachen, ganzrandigen Laubblätter sind in der Knospenlage gerollt: Wie auch bei der Schwestergruppe der Strelitziaceae zeigen die Laubblätter convolute Vernation (gerollte Knospenlage). Sie sind deutlich in Blattstiel und Blattspreite gegliedert. Die Blattspreite ist länglich oder länglich-elliptisch geformt, sie erreicht eine Länge von zwei bis drei Metern bei einer Breite von 30 bis 60 Zentimetern. Ältere Blätter sind oft mehrfach bis zur Mittelrippe eingerissen.\n\nBlütenstände und Blüten\n\nDer endständige Blütenstand hängt meist über, manchmal steht er jedoch auch aufrecht. Er ist mit zahlreichen grünen, braunen oder rot-violetten Hochblättern besetzt, die nach und nach abfallen. An der Unterseite eines jeden Hochblatts befinden sich mehrere Blüten in einer oder zwei Reihen. Die zwittrigen oder eingeschlechtigen Blüten sind zygomorph und dreizählig. Oft werden sie durch Fledertiere bestäubt: Chiropterophilie. An der Basis des Blütenstandes sind die Blüten weiblich (mit verkümmerten Staubblättern) oder zwittrig, zum Ende des Blütenstandes hin befinden sich männliche Blüten mit fünf Staubblättern. Fünf der sechs Blütenhüllblätter sind zu einer Röhre verwachsen, die an einer Seite bis zum Grund aufreißt.\n\nFruchtstände, Früchte und Samen\n\nDer Fruchtstand von Bananen wird als „Büschel“ bezeichnet. Ein „Büschel“ kann aus 6 bis 20 sogenannten „Händen“ bestehen, welche die einzelnen Reihen eines Büschels umfassen. Die einzelnen Früchte, die botanisch zu den Beeren gehören, werden meist 20 bis 35 Zentimeter lang und auch als „Finger“ bezeichnet. Sie sind länglich geformt, meist gekrümmt, im Querschnitt leicht kantig. Die Krümmung entsteht aufgrund des negativen Geotropismus'. Jede „Hand“ eines „Büschels“ enthält etwa 8 bis 20 „Finger“.\n\nChromosomensätze\n\nJe nach Sektion beträgt die Chromosomengrundzahl x = 10 oder 11. Bei den Wildformen ist meist Diploidie vorhanden. Kulturformen weisen andere Ploidiegrade, beispielsweise Triploidie auf.\n\nSchädlinge\n\nAuf den Staudenblättern der Dessertbanane breitet sich der Pilz Black sigatoka aus, weshalb industriell betriebene Bananenplantagen einmal pro Woche mit Fungiziden besprüht werden.\n\n\nNutzung\n\nNahrungsmittel\n\nDas „Fruchtfleisch“ vieler Sorten der Musa × paradisiaca und anderer Hybriden ist essbar. Die Zuchtbananen bringen es heute zusammen auf über 1000 Kreuzungen und Varianten.\nNeben den mehlig-süßen Dessertbananen sind auch Kochbananen eine bedeutende Nahrungsquelle. Ihr weißlich-gelbes Fruchtfleisch, das im Geschmack mild bis leicht säuerlich ist, ist nicht zum Rohverzehr geeignet. Es wird sowohl gekocht als auch gebacken oder gegrillt. Ferner werden auch Bananenblüten (auch als „Bananenherzen“ bezeichnet) in der südostasiatischen Küche als Frucht verwendet, während Bananenblätter oft als eine Art Serviertablett oder geschmackstragende Back- und Grillhülle dienen.\n\nTextilien\n\nVon den in Indonesien verbreiteten Faserbananen (Musa textilis), Abacá genannt, werden die sogenannten Manilafasern der Blattscheiden zu Netzen, Tauwerk und Garnen verarbeitet.\n\nZierpflanzen\n\nVon einigen Bananenarten werden Sorten weltweit auch als Zimmerpflanze verwendet – aufgrund ihrer Größe jedoch vornehmlich für Wintergärten. Dafür werden reine Zierpflanzen oder auch Fruchtpflanzen genutzt. Die bekannteste „winterharte“ Bananenart ist die Japanische Faserbanane (Musa basjoo); von ihr sind mehrere Sorten mit verbesserter Frostresistenz gezüchtet worden.","result":{"containerId":"3c4b0634-29cf-4489-83c0-e4c68fef5912","begin":0,"end":0,"sofa":"Die Bananen (Musa), veraltet Paradiesfeigen, sind eine Pflanzengattung in der Familie der Bananengewächse (Musaceae) innerhalb der Einkeimblättrigen Pflanzen (Monokotyledonen).

Pfirsich (Prunus persica) ist eine Pflanzenart aus der Gattung Prunus innerhalb der Familie der Rosengewächse (Rosaceae). Seine Früchte werden Pfirsiche genannt und zählen zum Steinobst.\n\n\nBeschreibung\n\nVegetative Merkmale\n\nDer Pfirsich ist ein Baum, der Wuchshöhen von 1 bis zu 8 Metern erreicht. Seine Zweige sind gerade und kahl. Junge Zweige sind auf der Sonnenseite rot und auf der von der Sonne abgewandten Seite grün. Die Langtriebe besitzen eine Endknospe. Seitenknospen sind zumindest bei starken Langtrieben in der Regel zu dritt in Blattachseln vorhanden. Die Knospen sind behaart.\nDie wechselständige angeordneten Laubblätter sind in Blattstiel und Blattspreite gegliedert. Der Blattstiel hat eine Länge von 1 bis 1,5 Zentimetern. Die einfache Blattspreite ist bei einer Länge von 8 bis 15 Zentimetern sowie einer Breite von 2 bis 4 Zentimetern lanzettlich mit breit keilförmiger Spreitenbasis und spitzem bis lang zugespitztem oberen Ende. Der Blattrand ist in der Regel doppelt und mehr oder weniger fein gezähnt. Die breiteste Stelle der Blattspreite befindet sich in der Mitte oder etwas oberhalb. Blattober- und Unterseite sind dunkelgrün und kahl. In Knospenlage sind die Blätter gefaltet.\n\nGenerative Merkmale\n\nDie Blütezeit liegt in Mitteleuropa im April. Die meist einzelnen Blüten sind sehr kurz gestielt oder fast sitzend. Sie sind am Grund von Knospenschuppen umgeben und entfalten sich noch vor den Blättern. Die zwittrigen Blüten sind bei einem Durchmesser von 2,5 bis 3,5 Zentimetern radiärsymmetrisch und fünfzählig mit doppelter Blütenhülle. Der Blütenbecher ist glockig, Länge und Breite sind ungefähr gleich. Die fünf Kelchblätter sind ganzrandig und an ihrer Außenseite wollig behaart. Die fünf meist tief, selten blass rosafarbenen Kronblätter sind bis zu 2 Zentimeter lang, oval und meist ganzrandig. Die ungefähr 20 meist rötlichen, selten auch gelben Staubblätter sind geringfügig kürzer als die Kronblätter.\n\nReifende Pfirsichfrucht (Durchmesser drei Zentimeter, Mitte Juni) mit samtiger Behaarung\n\nReife Pfirsichfrüchte (Durchmesser acht Zentimeter, Ende September)\nDie meist kugelige Steinfrucht hat einen Durchmesser von 4 bis 10 Zentimetern und eine Längsfurche. Die Fruchtschale ist blassgrün oder gelb, auf der Sonnenseite rötlich überlaufen und oft mit einer samtigen Behaarung bedeckt, aber dennoch glatt. Das „Fruchtfleisch“ ist saftig, dickschichtig und blaßgrün oder orange.\n\nDas Innere eines Pfirsichkerns\nDer meist fast kugelige Steinkern hat eine dicke Schale, tiefe Furchen und ist sehr hart.\nDie Chromosomenzahl beträgt 2n = 16.\n\n\nSorten\n\nKriterium: Fruchtfleischfarbe / Art der Kernlösung\n\nEs gibt weiß-, gelb- und rotfleischige Sorten und darunter solche, die steinlösend („Freestones“, „Kerngeber“) und nichtsteinlösend („Clingstones“, „Durantien“) sind.\n\nSorten\n\nEs gibt zahlreiche Pfirsichsorten (Auswahl):\nBenedicte\nDiniert\nFrüher Alexander\nFrüher Roter Ingelheimer\nRed Haven\nRevita\nRoter Ellerstädter (= 'Kernechter vom Vorgebirge'/'Vorgebirgspfirsich')\nRekord aus Alfter (= 'Rekord von Alfter')\nSuncrest\nSouth Haven\nRoter Weinbergpfirsich – Der 'Weinbergpfirsich' hat ein dunkelrotes, sehr festes „Fruchtfleisch“ und eine dunkle, pelzige Haut.

Plattpfirsiche werden in den letzten Jahren unter der Bezeichnung „Wildpfirsiche“, „Adelsbergpfirsiche“, „Bergpfirsiche“, \"Saturnpfirsiche\" oder „Weinbergspfirsiche“ häufiger im Obsthandel (meist zu höheren Preisen als „Rundpfirsiche“) angeboten.\nDie ebenfalls verwendete, aber missbräuchliche Bezeichnung als „Weingartenpfirsich“ ist in Österreich nicht zulässig, da es sich dabei um eine registrierte Bezeichnung handelt.\n\nNektarine\n\nDie Nektarine (Prunus persica var. nucipersica) stellt ebenfalls eine Varietät oder Mutation des Pfirsichs mit glatter Schale und im Mittel kleineren Früchten dar. Von dieser gibt es ebenfalls zahlreiche Sorten.\nEine neuere Hybride ist die Nectavigne. Diese ist aus einer Kreuzung der Nektarine und dem 'Lyonaiser Weinbergpfirsich' entstanden.\n\n\nVerwendung\n\nGroße Mengenanteile der Pfirsichfrüchte werden frisch als Obst vermarktet. Pfirsiche in Hälften oder Schnitzen sind eine verbreitete Form der Obstkonserve. Die Kerne werden aus der Schale gelöst, zu Persipan verarbeitet und in der Aromatisierung von Spirituosen verwendet.\nEs gibt auch einige Beschreibungen zur arzneilichen Verwendung des Pfirsichs. Beispielsweise empfahl Hildegard von Bingen die unreife Frucht samt Kernen, die Blätter, die Wurzel, das Harz und die Rinde zur äußerlichen Anwendung bei tränenden Augen, Kopfschmerzen und Gicht. Der Samen kann in großen Mengen giftig sein, da er etwa 6,5 % Blausäure abspaltendes Amygdalin enthält. Die Blätter enthalten ein verwandtes Blausäureglykosid.\nDie gummiähnliche Ausscheidung der Frucht wurde bis zur Herstellung synthetischen Klebers in manchen Gegenden als Klebstoff verwendet.\n","result":{"containerId":"5d6de50c-dcfa-4133-aa57-9f03bbfc1a65","begin":0,"end":0,"sofa":"Der Pfirsich (Prunus persica) ist eine Pflanzenart aus der Gattung Prunus innerhalb der Familie der Rosengewächse (Rosaceae).

Seine Zweige sind gerade und kahl. Junge Zweige sind auf der Sonnenseite rot und auf der von der Sonne abgewandten Seite grün. Die Langtriebe besitzen eine Endknospe. Seitenknospen sind zumindest bei starken Langtrieben in der Regel zu dritt in Blattachseln vorhanden. Die Knospen sind behaart.\nDie wechselständige angeordneten Laubblätter sind in Blattstiel und Blattspreite gegliedert. Der Blattstiel hat eine Länge von 1 bis 1,5 Zentimetern. Die einfache Blattspreite ist bei einer Länge von 8 bis 15 Zentimetern sowie einer Breite von 2 bis 4 Zentimetern lanzettlich mit breit keilförmiger Spreitenbasis und spitzem bis lang zugespitztem oberen Ende. Der Blattrand ist in der Regel doppelt und mehr oder weniger fein gezähnt. Die breiteste Stelle der Blattspreite befindet sich in der Mitte oder etwas oberhalb. Blattober- und Unterseite sind dunkelgrün und kahl. In Knospenlage sind die Blätter gefaltet.\n\nGenerative Merkmale\n\nDie Blütezeit liegt in Mitteleuropa im April. Die meist einzelnen Blüten sind sehr kurz gestielt oder fast sitzend. Sie sind am Grund von Knospenschuppen umgeben und entfalten sich noch vor den Blättern. Die zwittrigen Blüten sind bei einem Durchmesser von 2,5 bis 3,5 Zentimetern radiärsymmetrisch und fünfzählig mit doppelter Blütenhülle. Der Blütenbecher ist glockig, Länge und Breite sind ungefähr gleich. Die fünf Kelchblätter sind ganzrandig und an ihrer Außenseite wollig behaart.
